                <p> Hello ! üññüèΩ
                    
                    <br/><br/>
                    I am a 3rd year Student in an Honour Program degree called "<a href="https://reseau-figure.fr/about-cmi/?lang=en">CMI</a>"  at Avignon University. The CMI is committed to training scientific experts in their field and is capable of taking up challenges. It offers students an engineering curriculum that meets international standards, provide a 5-year, selective, and reinforced university education, and co-construct with the students their personal and professional project. In this CMI, during the first 3 years (Undergraduate studies), I was studying Computer Science and now I'm currently moving on to an apprenticeship master's degree in Artificial Intelligence.

                    <br/><br/>For 3 years, I've been learning as a self-taught Artificial Intelligence, especially in Artificial Neural Networks. I'm deeply interested in Neural Networks Architectures and how to make them more efficient in a specialized area such as Speech Processing.</p>

                        <br/><br/>
                        I worked under the supervision of Associate Prof Titouan Parcollet (LIA and Adjunct Researcher at Cambridge University). <br/><br/>

                        I have investigated different ways of making LiGRU a mandatory alternative to LSTM/GRU for speech processing. There is theoretical and empirical evidence that LiGRU simply is better than LSTM and GRU. 

                        Unfortunately, LiGRU suffers from poor GPU implementation and instability in the recurrent connection. 
                        
                        <br/><br/>
                        I reduced by <b>4x</b> the computation time of the LiGRU by implementing from scratch the <b>Backpropagation Through Time equations</b> in PyTorch with torch.autograd.Function and by combining torch.jit.script and Cuda custom kernels with CuPy.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The work has led to a <a href="https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/pull/1263">pull request </a> <i>(currently being reviewed)</i> into <b><a href="https://speechbrain.github.io/">SpeechBrain</a></b> which is an <b>open-source</b> and all-in-one conversational AI toolkit with more than <b>4k stars</b> on Github.

                    <li>Research Project | √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (EPFL) | (Remote) Avignon, France | Ongoing Project
                        <br/><br/>
                        This project is a collaboration between Laurent Aeschbach (GoergiaTech) and the EPFL for the sponsoring of Data & GPUs.
                        <br/><br/>
                        We first study the literature associated with <b>EMG/sEMG</b> linked to the prediction of finger angles.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The sEMGs are sensitive to the factors of intra-variability and inter-variability which are a major bottleneck in the current research state. Furthermore, the cost of data is exorbitant which leads to a lack of data available for researchers which greatly limits the potential approaches e.g Deep learning.
                        <br/><br/>
                        We found out that these challenges can be partially solved by applying Transfer Learning / Data Augmentation approaches.

                        <br/><br/>
                        The second part of the project is to develop and validate our hypotheses within the development of our experiments with PyTorch.

                        <br/><br/>

                        <b>Stack used :</b> Python - PyTorch, Sklearn, Tensorflow,  Docker.

                    <li>Research Project | E-Magina | Avignon, France | 1st Year Undergraduate Intern | 1 mo. 2020
                        <br/><br/>
                        I have been asked to conduct extensive data scrapping, analyses, and modeling of an online french sports club directory. One other aspect of the work was to carefully design and experiment with a System Multi-Agent to automatically classify a club description with the right associated sports.
                        <br/><br/>The idea behind it was to create the first accessible french directory that could be used to search for a sports club easily contrary to the oldest available website that was not designed for this purpose. Only the name, city, and a short description of the sports club were provided in the database.
                        <br/><br/>
                        We showed that by using a System-Multi Agent (SMA) in the context of a low-resource dataset that the SMA was by a large margin better than a Recurrent Neural Networks in this specific context.

                        The Chaire LIAvignon is organizing the AI challenge, entitled ‚ÄúThe battle of series and characters‚Äù, dedicated to the students of Avignon University. The aim is to recognize which character of a series has pronounced a short line, based on the spelling transcription of the line and/or from the audio recording of the line. Recognizing the series and not just the character is also part of the challenge.
