                <p> Hello ! üññüèΩ I am a Final Year Undergraduate Student at Avignon university where I study Computer Science in an Honour Program degree called "<a href="https://reseau-figure.fr/?lang=en">CMI</a>" 
                    which stand for "Cursus Master in Engineering". Since 3 years, I'm learning as a self-taught
                     Artificial Intelligence and especially the field of Artificials Neural Networks. 
                     I'm deeply interested into Neural Networks Architectures and how to make them more efficient 
                     in specialized area such as Speech Processing.</p>

                <br/>

                <p>
                I only do machine learning applications that are in the scope of ‚ÄúAI for social good‚Äù and that are not too heavy if they are not usefull for the community because üåç matters !
                </p>

                        I worked under the supervision of Assoc. Prof Titouan Parcollet (LIA and Cambridge visitor). <br/><br/>

                        I have investigated differents ways of making LiGRU a mandatory alternative to LSTM/GRU for speech processing. There is theoretical and empirical evidence that LiGRU simply is better than LSTM and GRU. 

                        Unfortunately, LiGRU suffers from poor GPU implementation and instability in the recurrent connection. 
                        
                        <br/><br/>
                        I reduced by <b>4x</b> the computation time of the LiGRU by implementing from scratch the <b>Backpropagation Through Time equations</b> in PyTorch with torch.autograd.Function and by combining torch.jit.script and Cuda custom kernels with CuPy.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The work has led to a <a href="https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/pull/1263">pull request </a> <i>(currently being reviewed)</i> into <b><a href="https://speechbrain.github.io/">SpeechBrain</a></b> which is an <b>open-source</b> and all-in-one conversational AI toolkit with more than <b>4k stars</b> on Github.

                        I have been asked to conduct an extensive data scrapping, analysis and modelling of an online french sports club directory. 
                        One other aspect of the work was to carefully design and experiment a System Multi-Agent to automatically classify a club description with the right associated sports.
                        <br/><br/>The idea behind it was to create the first accessible french directory that could be used to search for a sport club easily in contrary to the oldest available website that was not designed for this purpose. Only the name, city and a short description of the sport club was provided in the database.
                        <br/><br/>
                        <b>Stack used :</b> Python - BeautifulSoup 4, Pandas, Nltk and Spacy.
